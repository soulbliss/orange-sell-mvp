##Security considerations

### JWT token authentication
- We store a hashed password in our database, in case there's any leak of data because of a data breach.
- The password hash is generated by adding a 10-bit salt, which allows for us to generate 10 hashes/sec on a 2.4ghz core processor.
- A JSON web token is used to authenticate a user's identity which is stored on the client's local storage.
- Fine for simple authentication applications.
- Web storage based auth using localstorage/webstorage are vulnerable to a wide open range of XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks
- A much better robust implementation would be to use cookies for the additional security they provide, and the simplicity of protecting against CSRF attacks. Or use OAuth.

## Design Decisions

### Maintainability
- We use graphql to handle our request between our client and our API
	- The API because of its strict typing and explicit schema definitions, it becomes easier to write queries that perform robustly and provide proper error handling
	- The API because of its explicit nature, makes sure the integrity of data in the database is maintained
	- As all queries, mutations and subscriptions are available in one place, it is easier to make the changes in the API and allow it to grow in the desired direction.
	- Graphql also provides automatic documentation generation tools, which make it easier to maintain the codebase growth

### Job market

- The tech stack that we employ, has a strong market of providing skilled developers who can maintain and develop the codebase
- Lots of developers can learn using MERN/MEAN/GRAND stack quickly because of surplus documentation and tutorials available
- Many are open source-based frameworks, which have strong community support

### Security and Upgrades
- React, MongoDB, Express and Node are heavily used by the community and have strong community support, and it seems less likely there will be any other major alternative emerging out, at least for a few years. Plus they regularly get security-based patches and upgrades.
